      The logistics of carrying my luggage in heavy snow started to dawn on me as the conditions outside got&nbsp;wilder.

      As I headed for the hotel, it began to snow. Thankfully, this was far more manageable than the snow I’d experienced in Yuzawa.

      After dropping my bags, I set off again. As I walked out of the hotel, a coffee shop across the road caught my eyes with its specialty coffee signifiers...

      I was staying across the road from <a href="http://www.kurasu.kyoto/" target="_blank">Kurasu</a> — a place I’d purchased coffee equipment from all the way back in Perth.

      I grabbed a takeaway filter and set back off for the train station, intending to visit Fushimi–Inari shrine.

      Snow fell gently as I waited for a train.

      Soon a train arrived, and I was on my way...
      
      Well, not for long. Due to the snow, our train abruptly stopped, and we received an announcement over the PA that our train would be delayed.

      After what felt like an eternity, the train began to move again. Sunset was fast approaching now. I alighted and headed for the shrine.

      Snow was falling thick and fast now. Nevertheless, many people — myself included — were keen to see the shrine regardless.
