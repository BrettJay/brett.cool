      One heavy night sleep later, we awoke to the sound of our phone alarms going off. We got up, packed our bags, and got ready for the day.

      We emerged from our Hotel lobby in to early morning Osaka.

      Compared with some of the areas of Tokyo we’d become most familiar with last year, Osaka’s streets felt a little older and grungier.

      We walked through the quiet streets, heading Northwest for the Shinsaibashi subway station.

      We turned north on Mido-suji street, and crossed a few large blocks of city grid to arrive at the Shinsaibashi subway access.

      We’d be traveling to Kyoto tomorrow through this station, so it was good to be able to scope out the route without luggage.

      Taking the Midosuji line, we alighted at Yodoyabashi Station.

      Exiting the underground subway station, we emerged near Yodoya Bridge, with some stunning views of the river and nearby architecture.

      Over coffee, we planned our next move. We decided to head south for the Shitennō-ji Temple—sometimes regarded as the first Buddhist temple in Japan—and then look around the retro-future Shinsekai area.

      After coffee, we departed for Shinsaibashi station, and take the Midosuji in opposite direction.

      After wandering around the vast temple grounds, and watching a procession in the main hall, we left the temple, and headed west from Shitennō-ji temple towards Shinsekai.

      We turned off a main street on to quiet side streets, the Tsutenkaku tower looming into view.

      We ordered our fried chicken, and picked up a bubble tea next door.

      Once our order was ready, we explored a number of the seasonings and sauces provided.

      The fried chicken was light and tasty.

      Once we’d eaten our fill, and washed down the fried chicken with some very refreshing bubble tea, it was time to move on.

      We headed back north, taking a diversion through an underground mall.

      In the underground mall, we were stopped by police. They were running an awareness campaign, as apparently more pedestrians had recently been involved in car accidents.

      After explaining the situation, giving us a both a free whistle and light arm band, we continued exploring the underground mall back toward the Dōtonbori strip.

      The Chicken Ramen was well prepared, but the flavour somehow both a little bland—and yet too meaty—for my taste.

      After a still enjoyable dinner experience, we departed, and continued exploring the nearby area.

      We discovered a nearby second-hand bookstore chain.
