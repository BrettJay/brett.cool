      The following morning, we set off from our hotel.
      
      We picked up some supplies from a nearby convenience store, and then headed through Shibuya Mark City, towards Shibuya station.

      We snacked on our Onigiri as we continued north, the scenery outside whipping by us.

      We crossed over bridges, the buildings starting to get smaller, and landscapes more rural.

      The sun was out now, and it seemed so impossible we’d be seeing any snow today...

      Our train made its way in and out of mountain tunnels, until suddenly our train emerged in to a quiet, wintry landscape.

      Alyssa took her first steps into the lightly falling snow, catching it as it gently fell. We picked up a pile of powdery, fresh snow, and turned it over in our hands.

      We continued, turning right, and heading northwest along Yuzawa Onsen-dori street.

      The last time I’d been to Yuzawa, the snow had posed a real impediment, making exploration rather difficult.

      Thankfully today, the snowfall was light, making it trivial to navigate.

      We continued along the road, pausing to try throwing a snowball at each other, before continuing.

      We continued exploring the floors, full of niche products and interests, before returning to the street level, continuing to the end of the block, and heading north.

      The sheer scale of Yodobashi stores never fail to impress me.

      We headed inside and explored. It’s honestly kind of exhausting—there’s just *so much* to look at.

      We had a good look around and, after mulling over picking up an external SSD for a little while, we left.

      Now feeling like dinner, we decided the time was right for another Ichiran visit. Google Maps informed us of an Ichiran in Ueno just a bit north of our position, so we headed back to Akihabara station.

      We hadn’t visited Ueno last year. It was an older, quieter part of the city, but still bustling on Wednesday night.

      We exited the station, and had a quick look around the main area.

      Though large parts of Ueno matched with my memory, there seemed to be quite a few new developments too.

      Truly, the pace of development in Tokyo is far faster than I’m acclimated to.

      We reached the Ichiran and saw a giant line snaking out.

      Eyeballing it (and knowing the line always continues inside), we were guessing at least an hour. Looking at Google Maps, we could continue our epic anti-clockwise circle route towards Shinjuku, where there were a few more Ichiran locations.

      We continued to explore Ueno nightlife, on our way back to the station.

      As we approached, we saw a small queue for the basement. We made our way for the back of the line, when we were stopped by one of the staff manning the line. He handed us a card, and told us to go to floor six.

      We made our way upstairs, and found the sixth floor of the Ichiran store just coming online—clearly in anticipation of the queues. We presented our card, and found ourselves close to the front of the line for the vending machine to order.

      One delicious bowl of ramen later, we headed off for a nightcap.
