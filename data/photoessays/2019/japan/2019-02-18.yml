      We walked through quaint, peaceful neighbourhood streets.

      Tokyo has some lovely, suburban feeling pockets mere minutes out of the main hustle and bustle hubs.

      We looked around inside the large store. On the liquor floor, I deliberated picking up a bottle of Nikka Coffee Grain Whisky, but ultimately ended up leaving the store empty handed.

      We then made our way back to the hotel.

      That evening, we headed through Harajuku to pick up some wigs for a future costume idea.

      After our nightcap, we headed back to the hotel...

      ... And decided to go on one last mission—pick up Nikka Coffee Grain Whisky from Don Quijote.
      
      We dropped our bags, cameras, and set off to Shinjuku, fully unemcumbered for the first time on the trip.

      We made our way by train to Shinjuku, and rushed through late night Shinjuku streets, for Don Quijote.

      Inside, we headed up to the liquor floor and... Could not find any  of the Nikka Coffee Grain Whisky left, despite it being a mere few hours later. Alyssa went to find a staff member to see if they could look up if they had any stock left.

      Just when it looked like a failed mission, I noticed one last bottle perched high up out of reach... I stood on a nearby stool, and sure enough, *the last bottle of Nikka Coffee Grain Whisky*.

      A successful Whisky mission later, we returned back to our hotel to turn in for the night.
