      I’ve never seen a more handsome yet comfy bookstore. It really is the kind of place you could spend an entire day at, from breakfast in the morning to drinks at night.

      We whiled away the rest of the morning at Tsutaya Books.

      Duct was a pretty little coffee shop, but clearly filter wasn’t their speciality; it was a very dark cup, probably should have gone for an espresso!

      We left, continuing for Ebisu.

      We cooked our meats in the Sukikayi broth, adding vegetables, noodles, and dumplings to the mixture.

      Our waiter was delightful, and gave us many good instructions for how to cook our meat best.

      One hearty dinner (and a few scoops of icecream) later, we left Nabezo, and caught a train from Shibuya to Shinjuku.
