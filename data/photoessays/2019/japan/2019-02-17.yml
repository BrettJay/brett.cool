      As we walked, we saw a procession of Monks ahead.

      Curious, we followed along side them, watching with the other visitors.

      It was an early, cool morning in Harajuku.
      
      We made our way down the crowded Takashita-dori street in search of comcrêpe—a crêpe store specialising in crème brûlée crêpes.

      Unfortunately, it turned out the store was closed for renovations.

      We found a dessert place nearby we’d tried last year, that more than made up for Comcrêpe’s temporary closure.

      At Croquant Chou Zaku Zaku, we both opted to try a limited time Blueberry Cheese pastry.

      The pastry was crispy and golden, with a light, rich filling inside. The blueberry cheese coating added a refreshing zing.

      The pastry felt so light that we decided to balance it witgh another snack—this time something more savoury.

      We entered Calbee+ and lined up.

      Calbee is a popular brand of chips in Japan, available at most convenience stores and groceries. 

      Here, they cook and prepare their chips fresh for you to eat.

      We reached the front of the line and placed our order.

      Once cooked, we took our chips upstairs to the dining area.

      The chips were very enjoyable fresh, in particular we loved the shoestring fry cut chips. They have much more flavour fresh.

      After a quick look around some stores in Harajuku (including a cosplay store with Anime wigs), we decided to grab an early lunch at Ichiran to avoid typical&nbsp;queues.
