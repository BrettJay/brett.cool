      As we walked, we saw a procession of Monks ahead.

      Curious, we followed behind them, watching along with the other visitors.

  - story: |
      Harajuku is such a contrast to the quiet, serene Meiji shrine. The young, fashionable city in Tokyo, it was quietly bustling on this cool Sunday morning.
      
      We made our way down the crowded Takashita-dori street in search of comcrêpe—a crêpe store specialising in crème brûlée crêpes.

      Unfortunately, it turned out the store was closed for renovations.

      We found a dessert place nearby we’d tried last year, that more than made up for Comcrêpe’s temporary closure.

      At Croquant Chou Zaku Zaku, we both opted to try a limited time Blueberry Cheese pastry.

      The pastry was crispy and golden, with a light, rich filling inside. The blueberry cheese coating added a refreshing zing.

      The pastry felt so light that we decided to balance it witgh another snack—this time something more savoury.

      We entered Calbee+ and lined up.

      Calbee is a popular brand of chips in Japan, available at most convenience stores and groceries. 

      Here, they cook and prepare their chips fresh for you to eat.

      The chips were very enjoyable fresh, in particular we loved the shoestring fry cut chips. They have much more flavour fresh.

      After a quick look around some stores in Harajuku (including a cosplay store with wigs for Anime characters), we decided to grab an early lunch at Ichiran to avoid typical&nbsp;queues.

      Some rather delicious coffees later, we departed Nozy coffee.

      We headed back to our hotel to drop purchases off, and have an early afternoon break.

      Later that afternoon, we made our way for Akihabara.

      As we arrived, we happened across Akihabara pedestrian paradise which—it turns out—takes place on Sundays.
