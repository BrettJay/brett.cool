      We arrive at Perth airport around 3am.

      Dropping our luggage at bag drop, we headed towards International Departures, pausing for a quick coffee, and to catch our breath.

      One comfortable, uneventful flight later, we arrived at Changi Airport.

      On most occasions, I’ve passed through Changi late at night. This time, it’s just before midday. For some reason, Changi seems less imposing, and easier to navigate during broad daylight.

      Our 2 hour layover allows us to meander to our next gate without rushing.

      The cabin for our Osaka flight is a bit newer than our first aircraft.

      I watch some movies, reacquainting myself with Japanese draft beer, while Alyssa reads and practises sketching.

      Several hours later, our plane lands at Kansai Interantional Airport.

      We gratefully depart the aircraft, stretching our legs, and making our way through the dark, quiet airport.

      We headed steadily north towards Namba station, the lights from cars, streets, and buildings winking against an inky blue sky.

      Late as it was, Dōtonbori was crowded with nightlife.

      We continued through the throngs of crowds toward our hotel, we’d be better able to stop and look around once we had dropped our bags.

      The room was a pretty standard configuration for a hotel in Japan, we gratefully dropped our bags in the cozy room, and caught our breath.

      Although it was getting late, we were feeling rather energised.
      
      I setup the Wifi router that had been delivered to the hotel for us, and we set out again, taking in the Osaka nightlife.

      We continued south, back towards the Dōtonbori strip.

      In the last half an hour or so, many stalls had begun to close. Yet there were still quite large crowds.

      After a few laps, we decided to visit a convenience store, and pick up an assorted range of snacks to nibble on in the comfort of our hotel.
      
      I also picked up a small bottle of whiskey for ¥238 (so cheap!)

      Back in the hotel, we munched on some fried chicken, and some other rather satisfying convenience store snacks.

      We turned in for the night, our only full day to explore Osaka ahead of us.
