      We explored some of the nearby souvenir shops, and I contemplated a number of small sling bags.

      We looped back around to Nakamise shopping street. As we walked, I noticed a guy walking past us eating a Melonpan with icecream.

      We hadn’t had Melonpan since Kyoto, the hunt was now on—I opened Google Maps, and navigated us to a nearby Melonpan vendor.

      One delicious, fluffy melonpan later, we departed, and made our way along the Nakamise shopping street.

      As we walked, a sudden murmur of excitment grew around us—very light snow was gently falling. Children ran past us, trying to catch tiny snowflakes.

      We headed east, past the station, and took a look across Sumida River.

      As we ate lunch, we mulled over what to do that afternoon.

      We had planned to go to Odaiba the following day, but our afternoon was rather free, and doing Odaiba today would open up our weekend.

      One satisfying lunch later, we made our way for Odaiba by train.

      We transferred on to a local route.
