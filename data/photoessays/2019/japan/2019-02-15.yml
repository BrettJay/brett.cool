      A short while later, we arrived in Asakusa.

      We made our way from the station for Sensō-ji temple, heading down Nakamise shopping street.

      We explored some of the nearby souvenir shops, and I contemplated a number of small sling bags.

      We looped back around to Nakamise shopping street. As we walked, I noticed a guy walking past us eating a Melonpan with icecream.

      We hadn’t had Melonpan since Kyoto, the hunt was now on—I opened Google Maps, and navigated us to a nearby Melonpan vendor.

      One delicious, fluffy melonpan later, we departed, and made our way along the Nakamise shopping street.

      As we walked, a sudden murmur of excitment grew around us—very light snow was gently falling. Children ran past us, trying to catch tiny snowflakes.

      We headed east, past the station, and took a look across Sumida River.

      As we ate lunch, we mulled over what to do that afternoon.

      We had planned to go to Odaiba the following day, but our afternoon was rather free, and doing Odaiba today would open up our weekend.

      ---

      One satisfying lunch later, we made our way for Odaiba by train.

      We transferred on to a local route.

      We spent the next couple of hours trying a number of indoor rides, including an inline halfpipe rhythm game called [Halfpipe Tokyo][h], a rhythm roller coaster called [Genkion Live Coaster][g], and a racing game called [Storm G][s]—where we achieved first place, and attained the rank of “Perfect Pair”.

      Many rides and a couple of hours later, we headed to the third floor, for a celebratory and potentially-alocholic bubble tea.

      We eventually arrived at TeamLAB Borderless.
      
      Unfortunately, there was only an hour left, and though there were tickets available, the staff advised us we’d be rushing to see everything in the time we had left—all the more reason to return!

      We made our way back to the station, and rode back to Shibuya station, to drop our shopping off at our hotel.

      A short while later, we emerged—far less encumbered—and made our way for Roppongi.

      We jumped on a bus that looked right, and rode to Roppongi.

      Savoy is alays a must for us, and the wait is always worth it. We ordered our drinks, and food.

      Watching [Bun](https://www.instagram.com/angie.mieux/) make the pizzas is a show unto itself.

      Before long, our Margherita Pizza arrived.

      The leopard-spotted pizza was hot, fresh, fluffy and yet _so crisp_. With a rich marinara sauce, balanced perfectly with the gooey cheese, and with bursts of flavour from the basil. It was devoured quickly. 

      Luckily, our Marinara arrived shortly after.

  - story: |
      It’s easy to take for granted the humble Marinara—_why_ opt for a cheese-less pizza when there’s a cheese pizza?

      We were just as impressed with the Marinara and its freshly sliced garlic and oregano herbs. Just as perfectly balanced as the Margherita, and deserving on its place on a menu with only two options.

      ***

      Very full now, we left Savoy, and headed out in to the cool night Roppongi air.

      As we headed north, we popped in to a Tsutaya books.
