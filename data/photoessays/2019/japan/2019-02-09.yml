      After a short break, we departed %Aribica, and continued west, up a slightly inclined path towards a temple.

      As we approached the crest of the lane, we watched as cars approaching from opposite sides navigated the single lane, feeling some second-hand driving anxiety.

      We continued up.

      We entered, the interior was beautifully presented.

      We ordered our drinks, made our way upstairs, and found a free spot to sit, crossing my legs with some (much) difficulty.

      By chance, as we departed H≈çnen-in temple, we spotted an interesting looking Tofu restaurant, and decided to take a look inside.

      After a quick pick-me-up, we left, and caught a bus back to the Kyoto CBD.

      We alighted in Gion, and walked from there back to Imu Kyoto Hotel.

      ---

      Later that evening, we departed our hotel in search of dinner.

      We made our way back towards Nishiki Markets.

      Just outside the market entrance, we found a ¬•300 shop.

      After a brief look around, we headed down Nishhiki Markets, headed for Gogyo Ramen.

      Eventually, we arrived at Gogyo. There was a bit of a line.
      
      A lady in front helpfully informed us we needed to add our name to the list, so I headed to the front, and with some help from Google Translate, attempted to write my name.

      Returning to our spot in the queue, it looked like there was a good half an hour wait in front of us.

      I couldn‚Äôt help but wish we could be passing the time in a bar, when inspiration struck‚Äîstreet drinking is legal in Japan!

      A light drizzle of rain began as I set off to find a convenience store. I grabbed us a each drink, and returned to the queue.

      Feeling like I was inadvertantly sharing a bit too much of Australian drinking culture with everyone in the line, we knocked back our tinnies while waiting for our turn.

      Eventually, we were seated.

      We opted for the soy-based Kogashi ramen.

      The ramen was incredibly full of flavour, with a smokey, charred flavour, well accented by the presence of chopped onion.

      It was a very unique experience, and similarly enjoyable to my favourite ramen in Japan, Ichiran.

      After a hearty bowl of ramen, we departed. Feeling quite tired from a long day, we headed back to the hotel for a nightcap before bed.
