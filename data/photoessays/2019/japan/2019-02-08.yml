      Imu was a beautiful, modern hotel.
      
      We entered, spoke to reception, and dropped our bags in the lobby. There were racks of self-serve luggage locks, we took two, locked our bags.

      The lobby was a pleasant area, with an elevated platform with seating, a Nintendo Switch, and complimentary drinks.
      
      We spent a few minutes catching our breath, adjusting our day bags, and tried the 7 Eleven Beef Onigiri.

      It was mid morning now, but check-in wasn’t until 4:00pm, so we decided to go explore the local area, starting with Nishiki Markets.
