      We entered the modern hotel, spoke to reception, and locked our bags with the self-serve bag rack in the lobby.

      The lobby was a pleasant area, with an elevated platform with seating, a Nintendo Switch, and complimentary drinks.
      
      We adjusted our day bags, and tried the 7 Eleven Beef Onigiri.

      It was mid morning, but check-in wasn’t until 4:00pm, so we decided to go explore the local area, starting with Nishiki Markets.

      We departed the hotel lobby, and headed back towards the main strip.

      The Melon pan was warm and fluffy, with a sugary crust like a biscuit.
      
      The vanilla ice cream was sweet, and combined with the bread in a very satisfying bite.

      After devouring the Melon pan, and with a fair bit of time until check-in remaining, we decided to heard towards the Kyoto CBD, to explore the shrines in the area.
