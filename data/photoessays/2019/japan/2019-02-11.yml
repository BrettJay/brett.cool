      We transferred at Kyoto station, and made hopped on a JR line train for Fushimi Inari station.

      We had accidentally hopped on a rapid train that didn’t stop at Fushimi Inari, so we got off at the first stop, and waited for the next train.

      Snow gently fell as we waited on the platform.

      After taking a moment to rest after our climb, we departed for the station, and made our way south along the Nara line, towards Nara.

      We had caught a local train, and decided to transfer at a station where we could catch the next rapid train.

      We waited on the chilly platform for the next train.

      We entered the temple, the scheer scale of the bronze buddha statue was an imposing and impressive figure to behold.

      We made our way clockwise through the temple, looking at the various displays and artifacts inside.

      It was now getting quite late, so we made our way back to Nara station.

      About half an hour later, we gratefully sat on our train, bound for Kyoto, sun well and truly setting.

      We rode back into town, exhausted.

      On the commute, we tried to figure out what to do for dinner. A highly rated curry place sounded good, and so we decided to make our way there, once we’d arrived in Kyoto.

      About an hour later we pulled in to the station, and we began our curry&nbsp;mission.

      We transferred to another train, and made our way to Nijo station.

      We alighted, stopped in at a convenience store to withdraw some cash, and continued, walking briskly through quiet, dark side streets.

      Soon, we arrived at the curry shop, or at least, where it should have been, according to Google Maps.

      There was nothing there.

      Exhausted, we headed back toward the station. After a brief stop off at a supermarket, we decided to make our way back to the hotel.

      One short connecting train later, we arrived at our hotel.
      
      Alyssa discovered there was a highly rated Gyoza place around the corner, so we decided to try stopping in.

      Gratefully, Sukemasa was open, and the menu was very simple. Gyoza; you simply choose the amount.
      
      This lack of decision-making was appreciated in our exhausted state.

      Our Gyoza arrived and we gratefully ate.
      
      The Gyoza were plump, juicy, and full of flavour, perfectly cooked, crispy on the top, and tender and soft on the other sides.

      After a dozen or so Gyoza and rice, we departed. We made the short walk back to our hotel, and gratefully turned in for the night.
