      Eventually, we reached a 7 Eleven towards the top of Shibuya.
      
      We entered, grabbing some breakfast supplies and drinks. We took a seat near the window, and ate our makeshift breakfast.

      After a quick breakfast pit stop, we continued north, passing NHK broadcasting to our left.

      The walk to Shinjuku was very pleasant down these pedestrian sized roads.

      Watching people go about their day as we chatted was a lovely change from the hustle and bustle of catching trains.

      We criss-crossed along paths, finding our way to Shinjuku. We crossed roads, took detours, as I attempted to get us to the ideal approach.
      
      I remember us being in the middle of a fascinating conversation on neuralplasticity when suddenly, after taking an elevator, we had arrived in Shinjuku proper, with large towering Skyscrapers surrounding us.

      Inside, we spent a bit of time looking at bags and accessories, and Alyssa finding a suitable Bento Box for lunches.

      After a good look around, we continued on, and made our way for one of my go-to coffee places in the area...

      On the way out, I checked the retail section to see if they stocked the glass Kinto mug my filter coffee was served in.

      Turns out, they used to sell it. Thankfully, a helpful barista pointed me in the direction of a homeware store opposite, where I picked up a [Kinto Fika set](https://milligram.com/kinto-fika-cafe-set-lunch-glass).

      ***

      We departed, and were now quite keen on lunch.
      
      We made our way to a nearby Ichiran, only to find the queue too long for us.

      We made our way back to the station, and across the overpass near Takashimaya Times Square building, for our second burger in two days.

      It was surprisingly warm in the afternoon sun. I removed my middle sweater layer, feeling hot for the first time during our time in Japan.

      Nevertheless, there were plenty of photo-ops in the warm afternoon sun.
