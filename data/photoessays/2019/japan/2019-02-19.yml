      We packed our bags, and checked out of our hotel room.

      We made our way through Shibuya Mark City to the Shibuya station, where we picked up Narita Express (NEX) tickets.

      We boarded our platform, and before long, our train arrived.

      On board, we had a breakfast comprised of Maisen Katsu Chicken sandwiches weâ€™d picked up last night, while the Tokyo scenery whipped by us.

      A short while later, we arrived at Narita airport.
      
      We checked our luggage, and were soon boarding our flight back to Perth, en route via Singapore.
