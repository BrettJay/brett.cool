      We rode the subway to Kyoto station.

      Picking up an onigiri en route from a convenience store station, we eventually found our way to the JR office, and activated our JR pass.
      
      We then used our pass to board a train bound for Arashiyama.

      When I’d made this climb [just over 2 years ago][jan17], the icy conditions on the day had made it quite treacherous.

      Thankfully, this time the weather was a bit more conducive to our footwear.
