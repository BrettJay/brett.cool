      We rode the subway to Kyoto station.

      Picking up an onigiri en route from a convenience store station, we eventually found our way to the JR office, and activated our JR pass.
      
      We then used our pass to board a train bound for Arashiyama.

      When I‚Äôd made this climb [just over 2 years ago][jan17], the icy conditions on the day had made it quite treacherous.

      Thankfully, this time the weather was a bit more conducive to our footwear.

      The rich, beautifully delicate broth lived up to our memories from our last Tokyo trip.
      
      It had been nearly a year since we last had Ichiran. It was worth the wait, and the trek.

      After a wonderfully filling bowl of ramen, we left Ichiran.
      
      As we wandered back down the main strip, I spotted some people with Blue Bottle bags.
      
      On a whim, we decided to catch the subway to Blue Bottle in Higashiyama.

      Back at the hotel, we took a couple of hours to do some laundry, as we‚Äôd be departing for Tokyo the day after tomorrow.

      After washing and drying our laundry, we decided to try the hotel bar for a quick cheeky drink.
