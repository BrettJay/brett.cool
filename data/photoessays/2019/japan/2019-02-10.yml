      We rode the subway from Karasuma station to Kyoto station.

      We picked up an onigiri each for breakfast from a convenience store in the station.

      We eventually found our way through the labyrinthian station to the JR office, and activated our JR pass. We then entered the station, and made our way for a train bound for Arashiyama.

      Last time I’d visited, it had been closed due to snow. Today, however, it was open for business. We decided to head in for a look.

      We headed up the mountain.
