          Glen had subtly suggested we check out Sir Charles in Fitzroy. I was keen for this, as were the other speakers, so with some time up our sleeve, we headed in an Uber to Fitzroy, decidin to drop by Everyday Coffee first for some takeaway filter.

          Above the clouds it was bright and sunny. It was hard to believe it could be dark and stormy in Sydney beneath us.

          During the flight, Patima distributed the feedback cards sheâ€™d collected from attendees at the Perth and Melbourne legs of the Deployment tour so far.

          The feedback was very encouraging, and the speakers all delighted in reading the feedback.

          Thankfully we were able to retreive the luggage before it was forwarded, and set off to pick up a cab.

          I launched into my talk for the third time â€” this time adding a little preface referring to an inâ€“joke the speakers and I had about my ironing on tour, observing the humour in attempting to use the mini ironing board in my Sydney hotel room.

          No technical issues appeared, thankfully. However, it was a little hard for me to get a read on the audience, and I started to speed up, feeling a little uncomfortable. This was definitely a mistake, as the feedback I got afterwards was highly positive, just that I needed to slow down!

          Adding a new section walking us through the process of marking up a coffee label, to styling it for print using the @page media query, Simon delivered another outstanding talk which rounded out the evening nicely.

          After the talks, it was time for the after party! As we had to be out of the venue at 9:00pm sharp, we headed straight for a nearby bar.
