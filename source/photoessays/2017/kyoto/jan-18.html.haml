          The next morning I headed to the train station, intending to visit Fushimi‚ÄìInari shrine again, now that the weather had cleared up.

          It took a while for me to appreciate the scale of the park, as I continued to climb through the orange gates.

          The time and effort to construct this shrine seemed unfathomably massive to me, as I continued up.

          I headed back to Kyoto station and took a train towards Nara.

          Soon, I was riding through rural Kyoto landscapes.

          Before long, I was whipping through rural Kyoto scenery (which seemed far more summery than the snowy weather I‚Äôd experienced the day before), on my way to Nara.

          In my mind, I was sort of relating the train ride from Kyoto to Nara to taking a train from Perth down to Mandurah or Rockingham, and was half expecting it to arrive in a small little town.

          But of course. That wasn‚Äôt the case _at all_.
