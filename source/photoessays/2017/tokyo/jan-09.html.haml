          Yoyogi was a vast park. I traced the outline around to the left edge. Being mid winter, it was a little too early for the Cherry Blossom, but I could see how beautiful it would look a few months from now.

          After spending some time trying to decide where to go (I was somewhat curious to try a Japanese Sizzler  branch nearby), I ended up finding a Hamburger BBQ place in Shinjuku.

          This BBQ place served up cheese burger patties on hot plates with a side of rice.

          I placed my order on a vending machine, and exchanged it again for my deconstructed burger.

          After the rather filling lunch, I headed back towards Shibuya via the JR line to Harajuku.

          In Harajuku, I again headed down Takeshita street ‚Äî which was far less crowded early Monday afternoon ‚Äî and visited a local Owl caf√©.

          Unfortunately they were fully booked, so I made a reservation for the next day.
