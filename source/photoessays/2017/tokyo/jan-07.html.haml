          After security and waiting to pick up a WiFi Hotspot from the Post Office, the next stop was JR East to organise a Rail Pass, and to get into Shibuya.

          On–board a JR Express to Shibuya, I got my first glimpse of Japan proper.

          I’ve heard a lot about trains in Japan but they still didn’t fail to impress.

          Of the 45 minute journey, the time between the preceding Chiba stop and Tokyo was at least 25 minutes, and then another 15 minutes to get to Shibuya station.

          Exiting the station, we weaved through the labyrinthian-like walkways to emerge at the Shibuya crossing outside the station.

          We approached our hotel to drop our bags. Check-in was 2:00pm so we had a number of hours to spare.

          We grabbed some drinks at a nearby Family Mart, and headed back towards the Shibuya Crossing.

          After a quick pit-stop in which I figured out how to get our WiFi hot spot working, we found a good Tonkatsu place.

          After lunch and a quick browse around the shops, we wandered around Shibuya, walking through parks, spotting some real-life Mario Karters, and generally made our way slowly back to the hotel.

          We picked up our luggage, checked in, and planned on having a little nap. A couple hours later we awoke to find the sun had already set. It felt like 8:00pm, but was in fact around 5:30pm.

          We blearily emerged into beautiful Shibuya nightlife.

          We walked back down the familiar path towards the Shibuya Crossing, the streets looked so different and alive at night.

          Fancying a drink, we headed for a nearby whiskey&nbsp;place.

          It was something to hand over a ¥500 coin in exchange for a shot of whiskey, granted it was a Suntory whiskey, but it still tasted better for the price than anything in that price range than I’m typically used to.

          We walked through Shibuya nightlife, heading for a highly recommended ramen place.

          Ordering was handled by entering yen into a vending machine, which printed tickets we exchanged inside. It was novel, quite convenient (language barrier aside), and efficient.

          One cheap and cheerful ramen later, we headed home, picking up some random goodies from a local convenience store, and turned in for the night.
