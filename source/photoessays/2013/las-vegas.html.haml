          Our greyhouse bus snaked along arterial country roads, heading northwest towards Las Vegas.

          Scenes of afternoon, sunbaked rural America countryside flashed by us.

          Late afternoon we arrived at the Greyhound terminal in downtown Las&nbsp;Vegas.

          We split up into two cabs, and made our way from the downtown depot to The Monte Carlo (now called Park MGM Las Vegas), located along the main strip.

          Traffic in Vegas is rather terrible. As we rode along overpasses and highways, we got our first good look of Vegas proper.
          
          We saw the pyramid shaped Luxor, the castle-themed Excalibur, and New York-New York — replete with a statue of liberty, and a rollercoaster built in to its exterior.

          Our taxis soon arrived at the Monte Carlo lobby.

          We entered the cool, ritzy lobby to check-in. A soon-to-be-familiar artificial, perfumed smell permeated throughout the casino lobby. Over the top, ostentatious archirecture and furnishings adorned the large, luxuriously styled interior.

          I ducked in to line with my Passport and ID, having booked the Las Vegas leg of our accomodation. We had booked two rooms, which ended up being on floors 23 and 28.

          As we waited to check in, an impromptu percussion performance began to promote the Blue Man Group. We, along with many of our fellow lobby occupants, swarmed to watch.

          After a short pit stop, Andrew, Richard, and Jared came up to meet us in our room, which they remarked was exactly the same as theirs, albeit mirrored. We decided to explore the Monte Carlo.

          Taking the elevator to the ground floor, we emerged on a floor full of slot machines, and an adjacent foodcourt — replete with a Starbucks, a Mexican fast food place, and a (probably mandated) McDonald’s.

          We headed through a retail strip in the casino creatively titled the “street of dreams”. We enter a menswear store called Misura. I bought a pair of Converse sunglasses.

          We then headed back up to the other room on floor 23. It was fairly similar, but on the opposite wing of the hotel to ours.

          By now, night was upon us. We decided to head out and explore the Vegas strip, in search of food.

          We stepped out in to the dry, desert air.

          As we walked towards the main strip, we saw some patrons riding the New York-New York rollercoaster.

          We followed the lights, and crowds along the main strip.

          While Vegas is impressive during the day, it is nothing next to the way it comes alive at night.

          We navigated amongst crowds of pedestrians, with a backdrop of glowing neon lights demanding our attention in every direction.
          
          Eventually, we came across an area a few different dinner options. Some of us opted for a burger joint, and Michael grabbed a burrito at a nearby Mexican place.

          We somewhat clumsily ended up ordering our meals individually for takeaway. Once the five of us had ordered from the same burger joint, our rather irritable server lost her temper at us, accusing us of trying to dodge out of paying the group gratuity by ordering individually.
          
          Truthfully, we had not tried to do any such thing, we were all just a bit indecisive. The burgers were good though.

          After a quick bite, we continued walking on, stopping by the Belagio to watch a water fountain choreographed to “God Bless the U.S.A.”

          I awoke early the next morning, and ventured to the ground floor food court, where I got myself a coffee from the nearby Starbucks.
          
          It wasn’t specialty, but it was a known quantity.

          I then walked around exploring the interior of the casino. The lights, the smells, the sounds of pokies and a buzz of people filled my senses.

          I awoke a bit later the following morning than usual. Both Butcher and Irwin were still fast asleep. I got up and headed for the other hotel room.
          
          I could feel the return of the nasty sore throat I had in San Francisco; the exertion and lack of proper sleep must have been running my body down.

          I met up with Andrew and Richard, and we decided to go to the Monte Carlo’s buffet. After a rather filling brunch, Richard and I decide to head out to see the sights, Richard armed with his DSLR.

          As we set off, we saw Butcher at a nearby crêpe place. I pop past the Starbucks and grab another perfunctory coffee.
          
          We headed off, coffee in tow, retracing our steps towards the Aria.

          I consulted my destination on Google maps as the bus pulled away.

          The bus continued down the strip of Vegas that Richard, Butcher and I had trekked yesterday. The scale seemed a little smaller from the vantage point of the bus, as we were whisked away from the main strip.

          The bus headed west. I alighted at a nearby stop, on to a street with a very different vibe from the Vegas strip that we had just come from.
