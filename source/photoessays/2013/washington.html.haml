          Our Greyhound bus headed towards Washington through the early afternoon. Onboard, I ended up sitting with a stranger, and had a conversation that I learned later apparently was quite audible throughout the bus. I guess our voices carried.

          An otherwise uneventful ride later, we finally arrived at the Washington Greyhound bus depot. From the depot, we headed with our luggage toward a nearby underground station, in order to make our way to our hotel.

          Mid afternoon, we arrived at our hotel.

          The rather infamous Allen Lee Hotel in Foggy Bottom (#{ link_to 'RIP in Peace', 'https://wamu.org/story/14/11/07/once_maligned_dc_landmark_gets_makeover_as_citys_first_pod_hotel/', target: '_blank' })
