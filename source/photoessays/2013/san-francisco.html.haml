          ## MEL ✈️ AKL ✈️ SFO
          We departed from Melbourne to San Francisco, via Auckland.

          13 hours later, we finally landed. After what felt like a long time (isn’t that always the way after a flight?), we were off the plane and going through customs...

          After some more waiting, we eventually cleared customs, and, once we got our bearings, headed for downtown San Francisco using the BART.

          As we drew away from the airport, we got our first view at San Francisco proper. It’s remarkable how different everything looks, from the air and atmosphere to the roads...

          Eventually we arrived in downtown San Francisco. As we stepped out of the station, we were approached by a man who asked where we were headed — turns out a group carrying large luggage makes you stick out a little.

          We told him we were heading for Amsterdam Hostel, and he pulled out a map and drew us a route, cautioning us to avoid certain streets.

          We thanked and tipped him (thankfully Richard already had some US dollary-doos), and set off according to his instructions on the map.

          After a bit of a wait in reception (waiting becoming a key theme of travel), we made our way up to our room on the second floor. Up a narrow woodens staircase...

          After doing the essentially compulsive checking of Facebook on Hostel WiFi, we decided to venture our and walk around San Franscisco.

          The first thing that was immediately apparent was how jarring it was walking and keeping an eye on cars which were driving on the other side of the road.

          As we walked, we decided on our first goal; to get American SIM cards for cellular data and calls.

          It was fast approaching dinner time, and we were really struggling with the paradox of choice. With the help of Google, we eventually headed for an Indian Restaurant, Little&nbsp;Delhi.

          The food was excellent and the service top notch. However, when it came time to pay, things got a little awkward.

          We still weren’t quite sure of the tip and tax situation, and we ended up separately paying tips separately, which we think resulted in paying them less overall. We felt particularly bad afterwards, given how attentive their service was...

          After dinner, we stopped in at 7 Eleven on the way back to our Hostel for some American treats.

          The next morning, we set off north, towards Fishermans Wharf, interested in checking out some of the scenes from Tommy Wiseau’s cult classic, #{link_to "The&nbsp;Room", 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/', target:'_blank'}.

          And the touristy thing of taking plenty of photos...

          At Butcher’s request, we took a detour to visit a location Google informed us was a filming location for The Room.

          As we came upon the street, we should have been able to spot it a mile away...

          Below the giant poster (and jeans, #{link_to 'bit of a story...', 'http://www.thedisasterartistbook.com/', target: '_blank'}), sat a spy shop, and to its right, a pizzeria that was location used #{link_to 'for an infamous scene', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UD2t3LImII', target:'_blank'}.

          Getting a bit hungry now, we circled the block back towards Fisherman’s Wharf, again feeling overloaded with choice about what to have for our first lunch in America...

          When we spotted a beacon of garish red...

          We stepped inside from the ground floor, amused by the option of taking an elevator up to the actualy restaurant.

          We decided to use the stairs, since we had the option.

          After walking our lunch off at Ripley’s Believe it Or Not Museum, we headed back towards the hostel to meet up with Jared — who had flown to America slightly later.

          We had provided Jared instructions while he was on Airport Wifi to get to downtown San Francisco and where to pick up a Cellular Sim.

          Knowing he was on his way, we decided to meet him en route to the hostel. It was a jarring (and relieving) to see a familiar face in a foreign country, as Jared strolled up to us on Powell street.

          After Jared had settled in at the hostel, we decided to head south towards the shopping district, and our very first GameStop.

          What can I say? Shops are pretty similar everywhere. But this mall did have kind of cool circular escalators, and the GameStop did have a neat Bioshock display.

          Anyway, after a bit of city trekking, we decided to stop in somewhere for dinner.

          We ended up at Café Mason, which did homely American cuisine — good garlic bread and gnocci.

          The next morning, Jared, Butcher and I set off early to look for some throat lozenges for Jared, who was feeling a bit under the weather after the flight.

          When we returned, we decided to head East and check out where we’d be headed for the greyhound coach the following day, to get to Los Angeles.

          We walked East through the finance district.

          After we scoped out the Greyhounds station, we headed North East and reached Cupid’s Span.

          It’s probably impossible for tourists to not take several dozen photos and panoramas of it. So without further ado...

          Afterwards, we headed north, back towards Fisherman’s Wharf, catching a Tram; incidentally named after Melbourne, Australia.
