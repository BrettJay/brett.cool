          Even if an Apple event hadn’t been scheduled for 1am Friday morning, I was finding the prospect of sleep tricky on the eve of Mixin.

          Not only were there equal parts nerves and excitement for sleep to contend with, but it also felt like there was a slew of tiny last minute things that needed to be done.

          At the stage door of the State Theatre Center of WA, I met the fellow Mixin organisers and volunteers.

          We checked in, and begun the last of the preparations; interior decorations and signage, the final touches in the courtyard, and a final tech check.

          And then, in what felt like no time at all, suddenly attendees were arriving.

          ## Art Directing Web Design

          #{link_to 'Andy Clarke', 'https://twitter.com/malarkey', target: '_blank'} took to the stage to give an invigorating talk, challenging web designers to think beyond the 12 column grid we so often turn to.

          First, he made the case for art direction in web design, and how it can affect and enhance the story we are telling, and that not all stories should be told the same way.

          It is not the fact we use grids that is the problem, but we’re often not taking full advantage of grids on the web. The proliferation of 12 column grids has narrowed our thinking.

          Some big takeaways for me was using more ratios in my work and to not shy away from using multiple grids (known as compound grids).

          ## The Joy of Optimising
          Following Andy, #{link_to 'Una Kravets', 'https://twitter.com/una', target: '_blank'} took to the stage to deliver a fascinating and energetic talk which covered a range of new image formats on the horizon, including FLIF and GIFV, and some fascinating information about image compression.

          For instance, it turns out colourising a black and white jpeg using CSS blending is more efficient than baking colour blending into the image itself.

          And to top it off, I finally (think) I understand why the GIF format yields such inefficient file sizes.

          Towards the very end of the talk, she applied all the theory to our very own Mixin website. #{link_to 'I found this hugely inspiring', '/blog/2016/11/05/be-open/', target: '_blank'}; it was one of the prompts to finally redesign my website I needed, and #{link_to 'make to it public on Github', 'https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool', target:'_blank'}.

          ## Coffee time ☕️
          I got up to invite people (not that it was necessary, I’m sure), to grab a coffee.

          ## Pencil Mileage
          Walking on stage to Kanye West, #{link_to 'Alice Lee', 'https://twitter.com/byalicelee', target: '_blank'} delivered an uplifting and thoughtful talk, on the topic of personal development and growth.

          In her talk, Alice identified four stages we move through as we gain expertise in a field. Unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, and finally unconscious competence. She suggested the phrase “pencil mileage” to describe the expertise we gain in a given field.

          Visualising the amount of time and effort an illustrator spends in terms of physical miles of ink or lead remind us that it’s the little things we do every day that contribute to our expertise in a given field, and that it’s all about the journey.

          ## Full Stack Anxiety
          A perfect compliment to Alice’s talk, #{link_to 'Joel Califa', 'https://twitter.com/notdetails', target: '_blank'} took to the stage te give an inspiring talk on the anxiety many of us in this industry feel...

          ... and also to take a group selfie.

          Joel’s talk particularly resonated with me. There’s so much to learn in our industry that it can sometimes feel overwhelming and exhausting — trying to keep up with everything — or even just knowing what to focus on learning.

          There’s more opportunities than ever in our industry, but there’s also more expectations too. Designers 15 years ago who could code their designs were a bit of a rarity. Now, it’s almost a requirement.

          And it’s not just that. Designers these days are expected to be experienced with prototyping, user experience research, and more. And with the landscape in modern web development, developers don’t have it any easier.

          One of the key takeaways for me was to take more time to be more thoughtful and intention with what you actually want to learn, and to prioritise general, fundamental skills over trends and fashions.

          > Your life in its entirety deserves the level of care you put into your projects. So put some time in... and design it.

          ## A CSS Eulogy
          Following afternoon tea, #{link_to 'Mike Riethmuller', 'https://twitter.com/MikeRiethmuller', target: '_blank'} took on a somber tone as he gave a touching eulogy to some of our best known CSS hacks, which we all know and love (or hate), and sometimes feel guilty for using.

          Going through a series of humble CSS hacks, Mike examined each of their histories, and one by one suggested modern, well supported alternatives and challenged us to get by without them (I definitely agree, though please don’t check the source of this page if you feel particularly strongly about it!).

          His experimentation on fluid typography (#{link_to 'which I’m borrowing right here', 'https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool/blob/master/source/stylesheets/_tools.mixins.sass#L18-L28', target: '_blank'}) definitely blew some minds in the audience.

          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a magician at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mixin16?src=hash">#mixin16</a> and it&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRiethmuller">@MikeRiethmuller</a> <a href="https://t.co/RojcIQVNhp">pic.twitter.com/RojcIQVNhp</a></p>&mdash; Joel Califa (@notdetails) <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails/status/791922066341507073">October 28, 2016</a></blockquote>
          <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

          A particular takeaway for me was the suggestion that CSS hacks are part of the life cycle of a technology such as the web. We start trying to hack away at CSS to produce components that aren’t natively available — such as the modal — and eventually standards emerge and we develop native solutions, like the &lt;dialog&gt; tag.
