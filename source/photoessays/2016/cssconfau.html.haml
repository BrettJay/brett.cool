          Barely a month after #{link_to 'Mixin', '/photoessays/mixin-2016'}, it was time to jet off to one of the main sources of inspiration for our conference.

          I arrived at the still rather-new Virgin Australia T1 terminal and checked in for my flight.

          Ally kicked off the day by examining how people less tech savvy experience the apps we design and develop. It was a

          A lot of the projects Ally encountered were novice tech user going from pen and paper to an app. If they weren’t new to it, they were still quite fresh to it. Probably got their first, second-hand phone from a market. Lck of connectivity in west africa. Broadband is very uncommon, or broadband is quite rare and expensive.

          Touch screens are easier to use than laptops. Most people are introduced to technology via smart phones. Very unintuitive, slow to type. If elements are offdcreen, they’re not discoverable

          We know how to scroll because it’s obvious. It’s only because we know how to scroll already. Better to have interfaces that tech savvy users complain about than interfaves tech novices can’t use. Avoid concealed tags like select tags. Consistency is key.

          As Senior Front-End Engineer at #{link_to 'Vox Media', 'http://www.voxmedia.com', target: '_blank'}, Ally took us through the process of making Accessibility a key part of Vox’s development process.

          As designers and developers, the impact of disability is radically changed on the web because the web remove barriers to communication and interaction that exist in the physical world.

          A key takeaway from Ally’s talk was that by designing with disabilities in mind, we create better products for everyone. The results may not always quantifiable, but we should remember that these decisions improve the experience for everyone, rather than considering accessibility as some sort of edge-case.

          For accessibility to be a key part of a team’s process, you have to make everyone care about it — not just a few people policing accessibility.

          In order to do so, Ally recommended keeping everyone accountable, making it part of the QA acceptance stage, and considering it as a key feature of any work.

          Valid things that are difficult to do with CSS Modules.

          FORC

          When one of the UI components is not imported anymore, at that point, it’s easier to delete CSS.

          Everything is a tradeoff. “Good or better”. What’s the cost.

          How CSS Modules gives value. Very simple class names during authoring, just stuff that makes snse for your module.

          Debugging: benefits of immutability. Look at a class name, and know what it means, without any more context. Explicit mapping to DOM is easy to trace back to source of error.

          Refactoring is made better by the dependency tree. As soon as a module is disconnected, it can be deleted. D4

          Barak took to the stage to deliver an entertaining and insightful talk about the gulf between a proposed CSS spec and its implementation by vendors.

          Houdini CSS Spec that will give you web magic powers.

          How CSS works.

          1. Stylesheet with CSS object model with all the properties, classes, and elements.
          1. Run through a layout phase, organise in final structure, block or inline elements.
          1. Paint phase, where we render thse components to a visual layout.
          1. Composition with the fully rendered web page.

          CSS Parser API allows us to implement out own constructs and custom functions and CSS at rules in the same way we use media queries.

          Extending the CSS engine itself. Select a frame from a gif, create a selection of image filters, in the same way CSS allows us to define custom typefaces.

          Typed CSS Object Model. Trying to get a value out of CSS and into javascript. Values have type, more context.

          Define your own CSS Layout with the Layout API.

          After a quick coffee break, José took us through some advanced image optimisation techniques and avoiding some common pitfalls.

          One of the commonly-used incorrect ways trying to hiding images is using display: none on content images, but the browser will still see the image tag and load the resource.

          Unlike the costs associated with some tecnical choices, there is no downside to optimising your images. The Picure element and srcset is one solution, but the markup and CSS is tightly coupled and keeping markup and CSS in sync is extra effort. Lazy loading is another good approach, but can be difficullt to get right. The IntersectionObserver API is one way to help determine when elements are on the scren and should be loaded, and by displaying blurry, low-file-size placeholders, it can give a better end user experience.

          Only 7% of images on the web are progressive.
