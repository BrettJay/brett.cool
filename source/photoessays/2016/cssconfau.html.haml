          Barely a month after #{link_to 'Mixin', '/photoessays/mixin-2016'}, it was time to jet off to one of the main sources of inspiration for our conference.

          The morning of my flight I awoke a bit tired — due to some unfortunate scheduling I had a rental inspection on the same day.

          I arrived at the still rather-new Virgin Australia T1 terminal and checked in for my flight.

          This was my first flight ‘road-testing’ the Late 2016 13” Macbook Pro with Touch Bar and Bose QuietComfort QC35s. Both performed admirably and made the flight much more enjoyable.

          The meager 13” Macbook Pro’s figure made PlaneHax rather enjoyable. I was able to, with the assistance of some dongles, start preparing some of the photos I’d already taken and start scaffolding out this photoessay (how meta). And the QC35 allowed me to listen to music and videos and focus nicely.

          One nice thing about the touch bar in this configuration is music/video and other slider/shuttle controls are super clutch for making the most of screen real estate.
