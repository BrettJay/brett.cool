> It hasn’t been a good 24 hours in local dining circles. Following the announcement that sustainably-minded New Normal is calling it a day, pioneering William Street craft beer restaurant and bar Baby Mammoth also announced it’ll be shutting up shop. The restaurant has been sold and will continue trading as Baby Mammoth until April 13, before being handed over to the new owners who will reopen the restaurant with a different name and concept.

It hasn’t been a good 24 *months* in local dining circles in Perth. Perhaps I’m just overreacting a bit
