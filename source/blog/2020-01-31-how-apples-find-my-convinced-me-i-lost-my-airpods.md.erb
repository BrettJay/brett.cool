A couple of weeks ago at work, I received quite a harrowing phone call informing me of a family emergency.

In a state of panic, I haphazardly packed my bag and quickly left the office. I can’t recall much of that journey—the adrenaline leaves me with only small patches.

I do remember being on the bus waiting for my stop—feeling like the ride was taking forever—and considering for a moment trying to take my mind off things by listening to music or a podcast.

But I was restless and eager to be off the bus. I couldn’t muster up the will to take my AirPods out to listen to something. If I had, I would have had to stop, and figure out where they were...

Thankfully, everyone was okay.

It was a stressful situation to be sure, and I took the next day off work to help look after the family.

Back at home that night, I poured myself a whisky and took a breather. It had been a stressful 36 hours, but I was calming down and gearing up for work the next day. It was getting quite late, so I began to pack my bag.

It was only then that I noticed I hadn’t seen my AirPods Pro in a while. I had been so preoccupied over the past few days that I hadn’t had a free moment to use them.

They weren’t on my desk—weird. I checked my bedroom, I rifled through my bag.

Nothing.

I felt a slight pang of anxiety. I can sometimes a bit careless with where I put things, but not usually _this_ careless—where _were_ they?

Then I remembered a new iOS 13 feature—Apple’s redesigned “Find My” app. My panic subsided—I was probably about to see my AirPods Pro somewhere in my house, or else perhaps left in the office yesterday when I left work in a rush.

I opened the Find My app, and as I scanned the list the reassuring warmth I was anticipating turned to ice cold dread. They weren’t at home, or work.

**Last seen:** 12:31pm yesterday, at the intersection near my bus stop.

_How did this happen? Did they somehow fall out of my pocket, and I was too distracted to even notice?_

Deep down knowing the futility, I grabbed my keys and darted outside. 

Hoping against hope the Find My map would somehow lead me to my AirPods Pro, and that no casual passers by had somehow taken them.

I reached the point they were last seen on the map.

After some time pacing, I conceded defeat and headed home.

I messaged my parnter Alyssa, letting her know of the development.

I was stunned and quite confused—I had certainly been distracted the day before, but I swear I would have noticed if they had fallen out of my pocket. _Did they fall out of my bag when I was rushing?_

_Did they blow down the street in the wind or get run over by a car?_

_Or did I leave them on the bus seat, and the last time the location was polled from my iPhone was as the bus pulled away?_

The following day, I contacted local TransPerth depots for their lost and found departments, but never really expected a call-back.
