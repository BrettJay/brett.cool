**Embarassingly-late update:**

It turns out thereâ€™s a limitation with iA Writerâ€™s URL schemes feature. Unfortunately, the path parameter cannot currently create new directories.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Currently, if the folders don&#39;t exist in the given path, they are not created. We&#39;ll look to improve this in the future.</p>&mdash; iA Writer: Get focused. (@iAWriter) <a href="https://twitter.com/iAWriter/status/1088322338020417536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

For the time being, Iâ€™ve updated the shortcut to create files in a flat directory structure (still assuming the presence of a 'Log' folder), like so:

```
Log\
  2019-01-13.txt
  2019-01-14.txt
  2019-01-15.txt
```

Over the years, Iâ€™ve tried different approaches to journaling. Itâ€™s been difficult to make the habit stick.

For every nice feature dedicated apps provide, complexity is introduced, and with that, hurdles  to jump through, when I just want to quickly note a few memorable moments in my day.

To avoid platform lock-in and distractions, I settled on a low-fi solution: each day is a text file, within month and year folders. For instance:

```
/Log/2019/01/14.txt
```

This structured approach is a great candidate for automation, and wanting to be more consistent this year, I decided to see how I could make journaling on iPhone more seamless.

## iA Writerâ€™s URL Scheme

<a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> is my go-to writing application. It features beautiful typography, and some very powerful features, in a clean interface.

The included [URL scheme feature][url][^1] allows you to launch the application, and read or write files with an â€˜ia-writer://â€™ URL opened in Safari.

[url]: https://ia.net/writer/support/general/system-requirements#url-schemes

For instance:

```
ia-writer://new
```

The â€˜newâ€™ command accepts a number of parameters, including â€˜pathâ€™, which allows you to specify the directory and filename for the new file.

## Building a date-aware path with Shortcuts

[Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/shortcuts/id915249334) is a very powerful iOS automation app, that can do some very impressive things.

We can get the current date, format it as â€˜YYYY/MM/ddâ€™, and pass it on to be used in the path parameter. Adding a â€˜.txtâ€™ suffix to the path tells iA writer the last portion is the filename:

<figure class="iphonex_frame">
  <%= image_tag 'blog/2019-01-14-using-ios-shortcuts-for-journaling/shortcuts.png' %>
</figure>

Running this shortcut opens the following URL:

```
ia-writer://new?path=/Log/2019/01/14.txt&amp;edit=true
```

Opening this URL launches iA Writer, creates a new file at the specified location, and â€˜edit=trueâ€™ opens the keyboard for immediate editing.

Add it to the Shortcuts widget, and a day can be logged with a few swipes and a tap from anywhere, even on the Lock Screen:

<figure class="iphonex_frame">
  <video src="/<%= images_dir %>/blog/2019-01-14-using-ios-shortcuts-for-journaling/widget.mp4" controls="true"/>
</figure>

Although simple, this shortcut has been very valuable for me so far.

Itâ€™s a nice reminder to keep in mind small, quick wins with software, which bring a lot of value by making day to day tasks just that *little bit better*.

Download, and play around with the â€˜Log Dayâ€™ shortcut for iOS here:

<%= link_to 'Log My Day', 'https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/254e156b29f4413db439da698220431a', class: 'shortcut shortcut--blue' %>

## Going further
The â€˜newâ€™ command also allows for a â€˜textâ€™ param[^2], which populates the content of the document. Shortcuts even offers an action to URL encode a block of text.

Hereâ€™s just a few ideas for content Shortcuts could include in a new iA&nbsp;Writer document:

* Your current location
* The current time
* The weather
* The currently playing song, if any
* A checklist of habits

And thatâ€™s just scratching the surface ðŸ˜Ž

[^1]: You will need to enable this feature under Settings â†’ URL Commands â†’ Enable URL Commands

[^2]: The text param, and all other strings in iA Writer URL Schemes, have a 4,000 character limit.
