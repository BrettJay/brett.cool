      <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve tried different approaches to journaling. Itâ€™s been difficult to make the habit stick.</p>

      <p>For every nice feature dedicated apps provide, complexity is introduced, and with that, hurdles to jump through, when I just want to quickly note a few memorable moments in my day.</p>

      <p>To avoid platform lock-in and distractions, I settled on a low-fi solution: each day is a text file, within month and year folders. For instance:</p>

      <pre><code>/Log/2019/01/14.txt
      </code></pre>

      <p>This structured approach is a great candidate for automation, and wanting to be more consistent this year, I decided to see how I could make journaling on iPhone more seamless.</p>

      <h2>iA Writerâ€™s URL Scheme</h2>

      <p><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> is my go-to writing application. It features beautiful typography, and some very powerful features, in a clean interface.</p>

      <p>The included <a href="https://ia.net/writer/support/general/system-requirements#url-schemes">URL scheme feature</a><sup><a href="#fn1-18315" id="fnr1-18315" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> allows you to launch the application, and read or write files with the â€˜ia-writer://â€™ URL. For instance:</p>

      <pre><code>ia-writer://new</code></pre>

      <p>The â€˜newâ€™ command accepts a number of parameters, including â€˜pathâ€™, which allows you to specify the directory and filename for the new file.</p>

      <h2>Building a date-aware path with Shortcuts</h2>

      <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/shortcuts/id915249334">Shortcuts</a> is a very powerful iOS automation app, that can do some very impressive things. </p>

      <p>We can get the current date, format it as â€˜YYYY/MM/ddâ€™, and pass it on to be used in the path parameter. Adding a â€˜.txtâ€™ suffix to the path tells iA&nbsp;Writer the last portion is the filename:</p>
      <figure class="iphonex_frame">
        #{image_tag 'blog/2019-01-14-using-ios-shortcuts-for-journaling/shortcuts.png'}
      </figure>

      <p>Running this shortcut opens the following URL:</p>

      <pre><code>ia-writer://new?path=/Log/2019/01/14.txt&amp;edit=true
      </code></pre>

      <p>Opening this URL launches iA Writer, creates a new file at the specified location, and â€˜edit=trueâ€™ opens the keyboard for immediate editing.</p>

      <p>Add it to the Shortcuts widget, and a day can be logged with a few swipes and a tap from anywhere, even on the Lock Screen:</p>

    %figure.iphonex_frame
      %video{src: "/#{images_dir}/blog/2019-01-14-using-ios-shortcuts-for-journaling/widget.mp4", controls: true, preload: 'metadata'}

    :markdown
      <p>Although simple, this shortcut has been very valuable for me so far.</p>

      <p>Itâ€™s a nice reminder to keep in mind small, quick wins with software, which bring a lot of value by making day to day tasks just that <em>little bit better</em>.</p>

      <p>Download, and play around with the â€˜Log Dayâ€™ shortcut for iOS here:</p>

      <p>#{link_to 'Log Day', 'https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d65113d70fa04ccd952b31e64546d647', class: 'shortcut shortcut--blue';}</p>

      ## Going further
      <p>The â€˜newâ€™ command also accepts a â€˜textâ€™ parameter<sup><a href="#fn2-18531" id="fnr2-18531" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, which adds content to the new document. Shortcuts even offers an action to URL encode a block of text.</p>
      <p>Hereâ€™s just a few ideas for content Shortcuts could include in a new iA&nbsp;Writer document:</p>

      * Your current location
      * The current time
      * The weather
      * The currently playing song, if any
      * A checklist of habits

      And thatâ€™s just scratching the surface ðŸ˜Ž
