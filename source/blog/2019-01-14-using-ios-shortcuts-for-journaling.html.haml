      Over the years, Iâ€™ve tried different approaches to journaling. Itâ€™s been difficult to make the habit stick.

      For every nice feature dedicated apps provide, complexity is introduced, and with that, hurdles  to jump through, when I just want to quickly note a few memorable moments in my day.

      To avoid platform lock-in and distractions, I settled on a low-fi solution: each day is a text file, within month and year folders. For instance:

      ```
      /Log/2019/01/14.txt
      ```

      This structured approach is a great candidate for automation, and wanting to be more consistent this year, I decided to see how I could make journaling on iPhone more seamless.

      ## iA Writerâ€™s URL Scheme

      <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> is my go-to writing application. It features beautiful typography, and some very powerful features, in a clean interface.

      The included [URL scheme feature](https://ia.net/writer/support/general/system-requirements#url-schemes)[^1] allows you to launch the application, and read or write files with an â€˜ia-writer://â€™ URL opened in Safari.

      For instance:

      ```
      ia-writer://new
      ```

      The â€˜newâ€™ command accepts a number of parameters, including â€˜pathâ€™, which allows you to specify the directory and filename for the new file.

      ## Building a date-aware path with Shortcuts

      [Shortcuts](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/shortcuts/id915249334) is a very powerful iOS automation app, that can do some very impressive things.

      We can get the current date, format it as â€˜YYYY/MM/ddâ€™, and pass it on to be used in the path parameter. Adding a â€˜.txtâ€™ suffix to the path tells iA writer the last portion is the filename:
      
      <figure class="iphonex_frame">
        #{image_tag 'blog/2019-01-14-using-ios-shortcuts-for-journaling/shortcuts.png'}
      </figure>

      Running this shortcut opens the following URL:

      ```
      ia-writer://new?path=/Log/2019/01/14.txt&amp;edit=true
      ```

      Opening this URL launches iA Writer, creates a new file at the specified location, and â€˜edit=trueâ€™ opens the keyboard for immediate editing.

      Add it to the Shortcuts widget, and a day can be logged with a few swipes and a tap from anywhere, even on the Lock Screen:

    %figure.iphonex_frame
      %video{src: "/#{images_dir}/blog/2019-01-14-using-ios-shortcuts-for-journaling/widget.mp4", controls: true, preload: 'metadata'}

    :markdown
      Although simple, this shortcut has been very valuable for me so far.

      Itâ€™s a nice reminder to keep in mind small, quick wins with software, which bring a lot of value by making day to day tasks just that *little bit better*.

      Download, and play around with the â€˜Log Dayâ€™ shortcut for iOS here:

      #{link_to 'Log Day', 'https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d65113d70fa04ccd952b31e64546d647', class: 'shortcut shortcut--blue';}

      ## Going further
      The â€˜newâ€™ command also allows for a â€˜textâ€™ param[^2], which populates the content of the document. Shortcuts even offers an action to URL encode a block of text.

      Hereâ€™s just a few ideas for content Shortcuts could include in a new iA&nbsp;Writer document:

      * Your current location
      * The current time
      * The weather
      * The currently playing song, if any
      * A checklist of habits

      And thatâ€™s just scratching the surface ðŸ˜Ž

      [^1]: You will need to enable this feature under Settings â†’ URL Commands â†’ Enable URL Commands

      [^2]: The text param, and all other strings in iA Writer URL Schemes, have a 4,000 character limit.
