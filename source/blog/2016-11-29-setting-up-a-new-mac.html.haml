        Despite living in the Mac ecosystem for some time now, I haven‚Äôt started afresh with macOS in some time.

        Unlike with Windows‚Äîwhich I‚Äôd frequently nuke to get that minty fresh feeling‚Äîthe only time I really feel a prompt to start afresh is with the arrival of a new machine.

        In the leadup to it arriving, I created a checklist of files to backup and must-have apps to install. As I collated it, I figured it might make for an interesting reference. So here we are.

        ## Homebrew
        #{link_to 'Homebrew', 'http://brew.sh'} is a fantastic command-line utility for...

        ## Sketch 3
        Sketch is really a no-brainer for me at this point. I‚Äôd been dabbling with it since version 2, but never made the jump full-time until Sketch 3.

        Sketch excels with UI design. It‚Äôs been purpose-built for this and once you learn the workflows many other apps feel slow. If you need anything outside that niche purpose‚Äîsuch as raster image editing or more advanced vector tools‚Äîyou‚Äôre best suited to complimenting Sketch with another application.

        ## Pixelmator
        A similar take on raster image editing to Affinity Photo, Pixelmator is a wonderful app which takes full advantage of macOS frameworks and graphic technologies.

        It feels slightly more analogous to Photoshop than Affinity Photo, so for quick comedy shoops I might turn to Photoshop for, Pixelmator now fills that niche. The iPhone/iPad app is surprisingly robust, and you can open documents created on the Mac with it.

        ## Affinity Designer
        For more involved vector graphic work I keep Affinity Designer handy.

        ## Affinity Photo
        For my light photo-editing needs, Affinity Photo is an excellent, lightweight, and zippy alternative to Adobe Photoshop.

        ## Sublime Text 3
        I‚Äôve been a Sublime Text user ever since the first version was Windows-exclusive, and it migrated to Linux and Mac with version 2 around the same time I moved to macOS.

        There are other text-editors out there, but none of them feel as snappy as Sublime Text to me. All seem comparable feature-wise, so it feels like switching to anything other than emacs or vim would be a sidestep, rather than a clear step up.

        Sublime paired with the #{link_to 'ayu theme', '/'} might be my dream text editor UI.
