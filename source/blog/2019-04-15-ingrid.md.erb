During free moments I had over the weekend, I devised and put together [Ingrid][i],
a free Sketch template for creating seamlessly tiling Instagram posts.

Ingrid is based on a method I first used to create a tiled image composition
for [Instagram][ig] when I finished my America Trip photoessays last year.

The insight: design at 1× 
-------------------------

The takeaway from that process was to ‘design at 1×’, so to speak.

The majority of people using Instagram do so on mobile, and a sizeable
proportion use iPhones. The majority iPhones display images at 375pt wide.

I discovered by creating a Sketch canvas at that size, and following a 15pt grid
system, I could better control and predict the way everything—from the alignment,
and spacing of elements, to the size of text—would display.

Utilising Sketch’s handy slices feature, it’s possible to export each frame at a
much higher resolution[^1], the end result is a high resolution composition,
that feels right at home, especially on target devices[^2].

Building Ingrid
---------------

It was Friday night, and I was enjoying a [13% imperial stout][b] when
inspiration suddenly struck.

I was mulling over the process I used to create Instagram compositions when the
name ‘Ingrid’ leapt in to my head.

Well, now that I had a name, I had to build it.

Creating the Sketch template was pretty straightforward. I spent some time
carefully puttig together the template, with an in-situ preview of the post view
when viewed on an iPhone X/XS.

The other 95%...
----------------

Once I’d finished the Ingrid template, [I put it on Github][gh], and spent some
time fenagling a somewhat-legible readme.

It also struck me as the perfect opportunity to play around more with [Gatsby][gb],
a static site generator I’ve been enjoying recently. Paired with [Netlify][n],
it’s really quite fast to go from [Github repository][ghs] to [live website][i].

I figured I needed a quick sizzle reel to get across how it works.

I blew some dust off my copy of After Effects[^3], recorded some footage with
[Screenflick][sf][^4], and many keyframes later...

This is without a doubt the fastest turnaround from ideation to publishing. In
fairness, the work *around* the work took far longest (probably because the idea
itself and the work involved was relatively simple).

Still though, it’s been a fun, tiring, and educational process!

  Last I checked, Instagram stores uploaded images at 1080 × 1080px. Although
  you can design for the right scale, some downsampling is inevitable.

[^2]:
  When viewing on a corresponding device, elements within Instagram’s own UI
  will appear to align with images inset by 15pt, it’s a subtle, but nice effect.

  In other words, I updated to CC2019, all my plugins broke, I tracked down
  plugin downloads from email, migrated them and my preferences across, and
  dug out the external HDD After Effects wanted for its disk cache...
