A couple of weeks ago at work, I received a harrowing phone call informing me of a family emergency.

In a state of panic, I haphazardly packed my bag and quickly left the office. I can’t recall much of that journey--the adrenaline leaves me with only small patches.

I do remember being on the bus waiting--feeling like the ride was taking forever--and considering taking my mind off things by listening to music or a podcast.

But I was restless, eager to be off the bus and driving towards my family. I couldn’t muster up the will to take my AirPods out to listen to something.

If I had, I would have had to stop, and figure out where they were...

Thankfully, everyone was okay.

It was in my bag. For a week and a half, in an obscure pocket.
