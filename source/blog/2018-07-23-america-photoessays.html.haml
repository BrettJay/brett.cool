      <p>There’s a bit of a five year theme going on with me right now, isn’t there?</p>

      <p>Five years ago today<sup><a href="#fn1-4878" id="fnr1-4878" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, some good friends of mine and I traveled around America, traveling from San Francisco to New York over the course of 3½ weeks. It was an unforgettable experience. </p>

      <p>When the recent <a href="/blog/2018/06/18/five-years/">five year milestone</a> of working at Pin&nbsp;Payments arrived, I realised the five year mark for our America trip wasn’t far away.</p>

      <p>Since then, I’ve been working hard to finish putting together a collection of Photoessays to chronicle our time spent there.</p>

      #{link_to image_tag('blog/2018-07-23-america-photoessays/collection.jpg', class: 'blog_img'), '/photoessays/collections/america', class: 'browser_frame mt3 mb3', data: {url: 'brett.cool/photoessays/collections/america'} }

      <p>I’ve been working on this Photoessay gear in various incarnations for a few years now. I’d already completed the San Francisco and Los Angeles Photoessays, but the arbitrary 5 year anniversary provided good motivation to get the other six done in record time.</p>

      <p>I had a bit of extra time, and so had some fun experimenting with ways to visualise the trip — taking a lot of inspiration <a href="https://gyrosco.pe/" target="_blank">from Gyroscope</a> for the timeline based design used on the collections view. I also had some fun designing layouts optimised for Instagram on mobile, and learned some valuable processes along the way.</p>

      <p>I also have some key takeaways.</p>

      <h2>Arbitrary deadlines provide focus</h2>

      <p>The list of things I want to do is—and probably always will be—longer than the finite time I have to work with. I’ve been wanting to finish the America Photoessays for a couple of years now; before memories fade with time.</p>

      <p>But there was never any burning priority in my day-to-day routine. A little self–imposed deadline really helps focus me on what needs to be done, and what can wait.</p>

      <h2>Done is better than perfect</h2>

      <p>It’s fine to be a perfectionist, but it can sometimes be difficult to push through, or demoralising, if not kept in check.</p>

      <p>I had a few ideas I really wanted to include, but couldn’t make for the self-imposed deadline. The way I carved up the work means I can (and hopefully will) add some of these features down the track<sup><a href="#fn2-4878" id="fnr2-4878" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. In the meantime, I was able to meet my deadline.</p>

      <p>That’s hugely motivating. I feel far better having shipped, with the optimism of being able to improve down the track, than missing the deadline and losing motivation.</p>

      <p>I may write up a little more on the building of the Photoessays and collection view at a later date — there’s a lot of fun stuff I learned!</p>

        <p>We arrived in San Francisco around 12:15pm on Monday 22 July, 2013. San Francisco is 15 hours behind Perth (it was around 3am on July 23rd in Perth when we landed).</p>
        <p>Timezones caused a little confusion throughout the process for me; as I had to reconcile timestamps on photos with the timezone they were taken in. <a href="#fnr1-4878" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

      <p>Better navigation between sequential Photoessays, a collection index that is actually designed, and an inline collection browser are just three of the main UI improvements I’m wanting to include. <a href="#fnr2-4878" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
