      Today I finally got around to shipping #{link_to 'photoessays', '/photoessays'}, a section where I hope to produce longer-form content with a focus on photography.

      It’s something I’ve thought about and worked on and off on a number of times, and what better way to finally ship the thing than with a #{link_to 'look back on Mixin 2016', '/photoessays/mixin-2016'}.

      Reflecting on the photoessays work I can see — aside from sheer motivation from all the speakers — the manifestation of many learnings from the Mixin 2016 speakers.

      Andy Clarke’s talk on art directed web design inspired me to design a non-standard grid layout. Una Kravets reminded me to perform some pre-emptive image optimisation techniques to keep things nice and snappy.

      Jina Bolton’s talk on design systems got me #{link_to 'thinking about how I could compose photoessays from reusable components', 'https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool/tree/master/source/photoessays/components', target:'_blank'}, and Mike Riethmuller’s excellent #{link_to 'fluid typography work', 'https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool/blob/master/source/stylesheets/_tools.mixins.sass#L18-L28', target: '_blank'} informs the responsive typography.

      I’ll have to write up some learnings from building the Photoessays section, or you can #{link_to 'take a look on Github', 'https://github.com/BrettJay/brett.cool/blob/master/source/photoessays/mixin-2016.html.haml', target: '_blank'}.

      But I won’t waste any more of your time here — #{link_to 'go take a look at the Mixin 2016 Photoessay', '/photoessays/mixin-2016'}!
