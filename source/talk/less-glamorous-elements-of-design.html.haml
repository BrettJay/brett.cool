        %p Hello, I‚Äôm Brett üëã
        %p I‚Äôm a designer and front-end developer at #{link_to 'Pin Payments', 'https://pin.net.au', target: '_blank'}, and a co‚Äìorganiser of #{link_to 'Mixin', 'http://mixinconf.com', target: '_blank'}.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Tonight I‚Äôm here to talk to you about what I‚Äôm calling the ‚Äúless glamorous elements of design‚Äù.

        %p What do I mean by ‚ÄúÃµLess Glamorous Elements of Design‚Äù?

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p I‚Äôm not referring to <em>clients from hell</em>, who always want their logos to be bigger...

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Nor even the so called <abbr>dribbbilisation of design<abbr>...
        %p Well, <em>not exactly...</em>

          = image_tag "#{@path}/designers.jpg", title: "Different types of designers", alt: "Different types of designers"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p There are many different types of designers, but for designers in our own industry, I often feel this palpable sense of anxiety and uncertainty due to the many differing expectations placed upon designers.

    .Content_row
      .Slide.Less_shouldDesigners{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Should designers code?

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p So who‚Äôs seen this great philosophical question of our decade, posited by the greatest thought leaders on Twitter and Medium?

        %p These questions, and others, in varying degrees of sincerity, to me, plainly indicate that there are many varying ideas and expectations around what designers in our industry should do.

        %p Why is that, though?

    .Content_row
      .Slide.Less_roles{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 There are various roles

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Well, obviously there are various role. Here are some current titles ‚Äî next week there‚Äôll be new ones.
        %p But when I see dozens of roles, and all this terminology I feel like the industry is getting awfully fragmented, and I wonder if it needs to be this way...

    .Content_row#fragmentation
      .Slide.Slide--dark{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Could fragmentation of roles be a symptom of fragmented education?

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Could the fragmentation around roles actually be a symptom, not the cause of varying expectations?

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Our industry is largely self-taught

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Our industry is largely self-taught, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs controversial to say.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Our industry moves fast

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p The reason for such prolific self-learning in our industry is that it moves fast. It can feel like traditional curriculums aren‚Äôt relevant for the work we do today.

        %p And because of that, expectations and ideas about what we should do change all the time.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Existing fragmentation of roles

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And the existing fragmentation of roles further reinforces expectations and ideas about what we should do.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/pathway.svg", title: "Pathways", alt: "Pathways"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And depending where you enter the industry from, it‚Äôs plausible you may unconsciously be guided towards learning some things, and overlook things that may be useful for your career, just by the role you enter in to.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content

            Our industry is largely self-taught<br/>
            Our industry moves fast<br/>
            Existing fragmentation of roles

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p I want to talk a little more about all these. Starting with the self-learning in our industry.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Curriculums being taught aren‚Äôt always relevant for the work we do today

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Part of the problem is that curriculums can feel outdated or irrelevant. Perhaps institutions have caught up in recent years since I was at university, but that‚Äôs certainly how I felt at the time, and with the rate of change, I could easily see it being worse now.

        %p I hear a quality which university is good at instilling ‚Äî regardless of curriculum ‚Äî is self learning.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Without a relevant curriculum, we have no guide for what to learn

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p But without a solid curriculum, we have no guide for what to learn.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 How do we learn?<br/>What do we learn?

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p How do we learn, and what do we learn? It should be a deliberate decision.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Known Knowns

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p There are things we know we need to learn, which we currently don‚Äôt know. In design, that‚Äôs often glamorous, visual design which we can identify as technical skills we need to practise.

    .Content_row
      .Slide.Slide--dark{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Unknown Unknowns

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p But it‚Äôs the things we aren‚Äôt even aware we can learn that‚Äôs really insidious.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Deciding what to learn should be deliberate

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Because what you learn should be a deliberate decision.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 But you cannot make an informed decision without all the information

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p But you cannot do this without all the information.

    .Content_row
      .Slide.Slide--dark{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Here‚Äôs how I learned

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p So I‚Äôve been speaking in abstract for a bit. Here‚Äôs my experience learning design.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/dribbble.jpg", title: "Dribbble", alt: "Dribbble Website"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Which brings us back here. Now I love Dribbble. I promise this isn‚Äôt a rant on dribbbilisation of design. This is in fact what got me excited about design. Nice looking, shiny pixels. So glamorous!

        %p To fourteen year old aspiring designer me, this was the pinnacle of design. It was enthralling, I saw these amazing looking designs and I wanted to do it too.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/skins.jpg", title: "My Aesthetic", alt: "Winamp Skins, Userbars, Gloss"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Actually, back then, Windows Media Player and Winamp skins were my aesthetic. And userbars ‚Äî shoutouts to silkscreen.ttf, and web 2.0 gloss, diagonal stripes etc‚Ä¶
        %p So back in the day...
    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        %video{src: "#{@path}/flashback.mp4", controls: 'controls', preload: 'preload'}

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p So here‚Äôs a dramatisation of the day my journey in designer education began, one afternoon after school when seeing flashy graphics on the web, and opening a Firefox 2 browser to google it.

        %p And so, thanks to a knack for Google, I ended up teaching myself design ‚Äî or so I thought of it ‚Äî through series of 16 step psd tutorials and the like.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And this is where a problem arises.

        %p Now this is a slightly exaggerated example, but when it comes to self-learning...

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Google is a great way to learn what you know what you need to learn.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Google is only a great way to learn what you already know you need to learn.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 I appreciated superficial qualities of design.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p The superficial qualities of design and the technical skills I‚Äôd need to develop.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 But there was more to learn.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p But there was so much process and technique I should learn that was invisible to me.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/jjg.jpg", title: "Jesse James Garrett", alt: "Jesse James Garrett"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Enter #{link_to 'Jesse James Garrett', 'https://twitter.com/jjg', target: '_blank', rel: 'noopener'}. He has written a lot on the topics of user experience design, including a book entitled ‚ÄúThe Elements of User Experience‚Äù.

    .Content_row
      .Slide.Less_pin{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p I became much more familiar with Jesse‚Äôs work at my current position, when we looked at how to make our design process more explicit.

    .Content_row
      .Slide#elements{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/elements.png", title: "The Elements of User Experience", alt: "The Elements of User Experience"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And specifically, this diagram. Here is something that didn‚Äôt come up in my google searches while learning design. I didn‚Äôt know the combination of magic words to bring it up.

        %p Now this diagram looks quite complicated, but it‚Äôs a brilliant encapsulation of much of what we do, and is still relevant now.

        %p I just want to start off with this quote here:

        %blockquote
          %p The Web was originally conceived as a hypertextual information space; but the development of increasingly sophisticated front- and back-end technologies has fostered its use as a remote software interface. This dual nature has led to much confusion, as user experience practitioners have attempted to adapt their terminology to cases beyond the scope of its original application.

        %p Or to put it another way, sometimes we design websites, sometimes we design applications, and the process differs between the two.
    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content.Slide_content--full= image_tag "#{@path}/duality.jpg", title: "Designing applications vs websites", alt: "Designing applications vs websites"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Now as unremarkable as this statement is in 2017, this diagram was conceived in 2000...

        %p Eight years before the iPhone had an app store, seven years before the iPhone was released, six years before Twitter, four years before ‚ÄúThe Facebook‚Äù, and three years before MySpace.

        %p This predates so much of what we consider when we think contemporary product design, yet it still holds a lot of value and insight.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/elements.png", title: "The Elements of User Experience", alt: "The Elements of User Experience"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p In fact, if we look at the labels on the elements, we have both an instructive curriculum of design skills to practise, and a design processes for websites and applications to refer to.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content.Slide_content--full= image_tag "#{@path}/simplified.jpg", title: "Simplified process", alt: "Simplified process"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p A simplified version of this diagram exists. Looking at this diagram, I notice a few things.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content.Slide_content--full= image_tag "#{@path}/skills.jpg", title: "Skills", alt: "Skills"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Firstly, it seems to me that there is a progression of specialist skills as you move through the elements. Most people can draw up high level goals or objectives.

        %p But as you go through the layers, more technical and specialist skills emerge.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content= image_tag "#{@path}/entry.png", title: "A common entry point", alt: "A common entry point"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p I feel the topmost visual layer is a common entry point to the industry for many designers ‚Äî it‚Äôs certainly how I entered the industry. It starts with an appreciation for the aesthetics of Design, it‚Äôs what gets us excited and our foot in the door.

        %p As we become immersed in the industry and gain experience, we naturally start to see and appreciate skills and techniques less appreciable from outside the industry.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content.Slide_content--full= image_tag "#{@path}/focus.jpg", title: "The overlooked layer", alt: "The overlooked layer"

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p As such, I want to talk a bit more about this section, right in the center.

        %p The surface layer is the easiest to appreciate. From outside the industry, you can recognise the technical skills required to produce aesthetically pleasing work.

        %p But this structure layer as a proficiency, was all but invisible to me as a beginner, starting out, and I feel one of the most easily overlooked, not just by me, but by many.

        %p Jesse refers to the tasks in the structural layer of design as Interaction Design and Information Architecture when designing apps and websites respectively.

        %p And again, Jesse has a useful framework for this layer.

        %p Which he refers to as a visual vocabulary.

          %h2 Sitemap?

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Oh, like a site map?

        %p Basically, yes! But much more than that.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p The vocabulary describes a wide library of symbols which are used to represent a user‚Äôs journey through an application or website.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And the various possible conditions and relationships between pages and states.

    .Content_row

        .Slide_content
          %h2 A vocabulary for visualising a user‚Äôs journey through an application or website, efficiently.

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p So this visual vocabulary framework allows you to quickly ideate and iterate on the user‚Äôs journey through a website or application, without having to produce high fidelity mockups or prototypes.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Requires no technical design skills

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p It requires absolutely no technical skills to apply. It‚Äôs a vocabulary anyone can learn ‚Äî anyone can draw boxes and arrows.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Inclusive

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And because of this, it allows for this stage of design to be a very inclusive process. Developers, project managers, and other stakeholders, can all use this framework to relate to the project, without a sense of not being qualified to contribute due to lack of technical skills.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Design with <strike>comittee?</strike>

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Maybe that set a red flag off, are we designing with a comittee?

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Design with context

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p No. I think of it as designing with context.

        %p Ultimately, designers are still responsible for synthesising from other stake holders. There‚Äôs a difference between having more context and delegating decisions.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Design with greater perspective

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Bringing on developers and other parties allows your design process to be informed by other perspectives, allowing you to design more robust products and websites.

    .Content_row
      .Slide{"data-aspect-ratio": "16:9"}
        .Slide_content
          %h2 Make design decisions more efficiently

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p Even outside a team scenario, being familiar with these frameworks will allow you to make your design decisions more efficiently.

    .Content_row

        .Slide_content
          %h2 Make design decisions at the right fidelity

    .Content_row
      .Content_main
        %p And at the right time. Too often I‚Äôve found myself mulling over high level design decisions while making pixels shiny.

        %p It was this comparison between the process of a junior designer, and the process of a senior designer that really resonated with me.

        %p To the left, she compares a junior designer process which appears to be all over the place, with no rhyme or reason, to a deliberate, methodical approach by a senior designer.

        %p To the left is me, every time I make high level product decisions in Sketch or another tool. To the right is a senior designer making decisions at the appropriate fidelity.

        %p Now I‚Äôm not here to prescribe any process on anyone‚Äîit all depends on the context of what you‚Äôre building‚Äîand especially not one that looks scarily waterfall‚Äìesque.
